### Insracart

#### Read in the data

```{r}
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Clean the dataset

```{r}
instacart_tidy = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    day = order_dow + 1,
    order_day_of_week = lubridate::wday(day, label = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  select(order_id, user_id, reordered, order_day_of_week, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle, department) %>%
  drop_na()
```

### Chart A

First is a line plot shows the distributions of order time during a day.

```{r}
instacart_tidy %>%
  group_by(order_day_of_week, order_hour_of_day) %>%
  summarize(count = n_distinct(order_id)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~order_hour_of_day, y = ~count, type = "scatter", mode = "lines",
          color = ~order_day_of_week, alpha = 0.8) %>%
  layout(title =  "Distributions of Order Time During a Day",
         xaxis = list(title = "Time"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Orders"))
```
