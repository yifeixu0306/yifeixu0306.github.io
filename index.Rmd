# About Me

My name is Yifei. I am a second year M.S. Biostatistics student in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. I earned my B.S. in Pharmaceutical Science from Sichuan University.

My research interests focus on the statistical analysis for longitudinal data, especially in the area of infection and psychiatry.

I enjoy watching disney movies and playing tennis. My favorite player is [Roger Federer](https://twitter.com/rogerfederer?lang=en)!
